	TODO:
- estimated coeff on portia
- plot mg and ctr for oob scores on one plot
- false positive vs true negative from 100 to 250 top links

- difference between oob scores obtained during calibration vs grn. These are obtained:
	-- calib: mean score across 100 runs are plotted for individual proteins. Variable is param
	-- grn: mean score across 100 runs are plotted for individual proteins. param is the average of 100 calib runs


# Network graph
different network graphs, one for each mg and ctr (maybe combined)
## nodes in the network graph:
- shape: role (critical, etc)
- color: OOB score
- size: OOB score,
## edges in the network graph:
- thinkness: weights
- color: validated by strings; 

## TODO: how to cluster nodes (?MCL)

# GRN
##Design:
### tune -> best params and oob score for each node and their plots
	- train on the whole dataset and use score OOB to choose tops
		-- start with 100 runs 
	- (*) extract best params and oob scores for each node (for each run) 
	- (*) plot best oobs scores distribution entire nodes (top 10 nodes in a box plot showing the quartiles)
	- (*) plot best params for chosen nodes (based on oob scores)
		-- boxplot for selected genes (oob)
		-- boxplot for pooled genes

### extract links -> average ws, sig ws, w distribution plot, 
	- (*) calculate the average params for each node based on best params of 100 runs
	- (*) use the average params
	- (*) run for 1000 times
	- show the mean weight distribution in one plot
	- (*-) conduct t test to keep sig links
		-- needs some work here
	- (*) if filtering was insufficeint, use oob score as another filtering 
		-- oob scores from  both ctr and mg simultaneously
	- (*) if filtering was insufficeint, use top m links as another filtering
	- (*) plot w distribution for top links 
	- (*-) plot t test or t values results for all links in one graph
	- show correlate OOB scores with sig tests 
	- run portia and combine the data 
	- (*-) compare the links to golden links 
		- (*) string only 
		- pathways common
	- compare extracted links to randomly created links statistcally 
### VSA -> roles plot, change in role plots
	- (*) analysize roles:
		-- (*) thresholds should be defined seperately on each ctr and mg (top quantile)
		-- (*) ctr and mg data should be normalized around thresholds (for visualization)
	- (*) plot roles for each ctr and mg
		-- (*) use different shapes for the roles (this should be similar to igraph)
		-- (-) map size to a quantity
		-- (*) annotation should be smarter on names: maybe using arrow
	- (*) plot those with changed roles and how they change (arrows)
		-- (*) define arrows from ctr to mg
	- choose those that are critical/active and study them by:
		-- variation in the role for different runs
		-- variation in the role for noise addition



# 
	- compare the extracted links to inferred, for both 0.4 and 0.7 confidence 
# PCA
- add to the results
