# Uncovering key regulatory mechanisms in the molecular response of mesenchymal stem cells to Mg2+ ions through protein network analysis 

# Content
- notebooks: jupyter notebooks to run the scripts
- data: the folder that contains original proteomics data
- statistical_analysis: the R script and the results of the time-series statitical analysis
- Proteomics_MSC: Python scripts that process the whole analysis except the statistical analysis
- results: the results exluding the statistical analysis

# How to run
First, install the package to avoid relative importing. In the main directory:

`python setup.py install --user`

Then, navigate to the notebooks folder and run the relevant section.
For DE analysis, we used R script. The code and the results are located in the 'statitical_analysis' forlder.
