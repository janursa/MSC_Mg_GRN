Job 0: Violin plot for all models
Reason: Input files updated by another job: results/model_selection/scores.json

Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in rule model_selection_violin_plot in file C:\Users\nourisa\Documents\testProjs\proteomics_MSC_Mg_model\Snakefile, line 150:
Job 0 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
results/model_selection/violinplot
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
