MissingOutputException in rule line_plot_shortlisted_models in file C:\Users\nourisa\Documents\testProjs\proteomics_MSC_Mg_model\Snakefile, line 173:
Job 0 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:

Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
