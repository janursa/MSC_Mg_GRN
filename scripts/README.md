
- edit_data: preprocess the original proteomic data prior to DE analysis
- post_statistical_analysis: to process the results of DE analysis to obtain DEproteins and the corrosponding data
- calibration: tuning the hyperparameters of Ridge and RF
- GRN: run different GRN methods 
- enrichment_analysis: obtain protein functional relationships from String
- model_selection: create baseline models, conduct model selection, and plot the results
- VSA: conduct VSA to obtain the largest role changes and critical role changes
- network_analysis: identify the top links altered across the groups. After, uncertainity analysis, plot the shortlisted network
- uncertainity_analysis: conduct noise analysis for the role change and divergence analysis
